                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Rishikesh</h2>
                
                <p class="center">Located in the foothills of the Himalayas along the convergence of Ganga and
                    Chandrabhaga River, Rishikesh is a small town in the Dehradun district, located close to Haridwar in
                    Uttarakhand. Rishikesh (also called as Hrishikesh) is known for its adventure activities, ancient
                    temples, popular cafes and as the "Yoga Capital of the World". Gateway to Garhwal Himalayas,
                    Rishikesh is also a pilgrimage town and one of the holiest places for Hindus.

                    Rishikesh became known worldwide in the 1960s after The Beatles visited the ashram of Maharishi
                    Mahesh Yogi here. Today, the place is popular as The Beatles Ashram which beckons tourists globally.
                    The tranquil town has long been a spiritual centre but is equally popular for the whitewater
                    rafting, bungee jumping, mountain biking and camping along the fast-flowing Holy Ganges. It also
                    serves as the gateway to many Himalayan treks.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Dehradun</h2>
                <p class="center">Dehradun is the capital city and the largest city of Uttarakhand. Dehradun is located
                    at an altitude of 1400 feet above sea level and has a pleasant climate all year round. Located just
                    30kms from Mussoorie, Dehradun is known as the gateway to Mussoorie and Rishikesh and Haridwar.
                    Dehradun is also known as the "Educational Hub of Uttarakhand" with some of the country's
                    prestigious universities and boarding schools.

                    As you would expect from a city located in the foothills of the Himalayas, Dehradun abounds in
                    caves, waterfalls and natural springs. One such popular spot is Robber's Cave, which is a natural
                    cave surrounded by hills. Dip your feet in the ice-cold water or walk through it - travellers are
                    free to take their pick, making Robber's Cave one of the most popular picnic spots in the city.
                    Another popular spot for nature lovers is Lacchiwala, where you can sit and enjoy a relaxing sunset
                    around the man-made lake and the lush greenery around it. Lacchiwala also has arrangements for
                    trekking and birdwatching if you're up for it.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Haridwar</h2>
                <p class="center">Haridwar is one of the seven holiest cities in India, situated in Uttarakhand. It is
                    located where the sacred river Ganga enters the Indo-Gangetic plains for the first time. Dotted with
                    temples, ashrams and narrow lanes across the city, Haridwar is a famous Hindu temple town where
                    millions of devotees come to take a dip in the holy Ganges. It's believed that taking a dip in the
                    sacred Har Ki Pauri relieves one of all the sins.

                    The highlight of Haridwar is the famous Ganga Aarti held at the Har ki Pauri Ghat every evening.
                    Thousands of devotees come together to pray to river Ganga and float diyas. Haridwar is one of the
                    four cities (others being Ujjain, Nasik and Allahabad) that host the Kumbh Mela every twelve years.
                    The Kanwar Mela is also organised here every year during saawan (rainy season). It is also the
                    gateway to the Char Dham of Uttarakhand and acts as the base destination for some of the other
                    tourist towns of Rishikesh and Devprayag.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Jim Corbett National Park</h2>
                <p class="center">Jim Corbett National Park is the oldest national park set amidst the foothills of the
                    Himalayas in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand. Known for housing the endangered Bengal tiger,
                    Corbett National Park is part of the larger Corbett Tiger Reserve.

                    Famous for its wildlife safaris, Jim Corbett National Park has multiple resorts set on the
                    riverside. Home to more than 650 species of rare and migratory birds, it is a haven for bird
                    watchers. The most popular attraction at Corbett National Park is Dhikala, a forest lodge located on
                    the border of Patil Dun Valley, which is known for the stunning location and rich wildlife.

                    Only 180 vehicles are allowed to enter the national park in a day. Jim Corbett National Park remains
                    closed from July to October during the monsoons. However, Jhirna, Dhela and Sitabani tourism zones
                    remain open for tourists throughout the year. Safaris are organised in all the zones by two shifts
                    by the forest officials in all the zones.

                <img src="MUKTESHWAR.jpg" height="330px" width="470px" alt="">
                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Mukteshwar</h2>
                <p class="center">Mukteshwar is a small hill town located around 50 km from Nainital in Uttarakhand.
                    Known for adventure sports and a dazzling view of Himalayan ranges, Mukteshwar is named after the
                    350-year-old Shiva Temple housed here called Mukteshwar Dham.

                    The quaint town got its name from the belief that Lord Shiva killed a demon here and gave him Mukti
                    or salvation. With lush green trails and narrow lanes, Mukteshwar is a popular destination for
                    trekking, apart from rock climbing and rappeling. Major attractions here are the picturesque
                    orchards, coniferous forests, rolling meadows, and little cottages and homes built in quaint
                    colonial style. The charm of Mukteshwar lies in spending tranquil time - enjoying nature and
                    listening to the chirping of the birds.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Chopta</h2>
                <p class="center">Chopta, a small hamlet located in Uttarakhand, is a trekker's heaven. The base camp of
                    treks like Tugnanath, Deoria Tal and Chandrashila, Chopta is an ideal destination for intermediate
                    trekkers to go on a guided trek and brush up their skills. Chopta promises a life-altering expansion
                    of your boundaries.

                    The third temple of Panch Kedar is located in Tugnanath, around 3.5 km away from Chopta. Camping in
                    the open grassy meadows of Chopta that slopes on softly, among alpine, pine, deodar and rhododendron
                    trees is soul-fulfilling. The snow-covered peaks of Trishul, Nanda Devi and Chaukhambha dominate the
                    panoramic views seen in Chopta.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Mussoorie</h2>
                <p class="center">Mussoorie is one of the most popular hill stations located at a distance of 290 km
                    from Delhi in the Dehradun district of Uttarakhand. With a backdrop of the Shivalik range of
                    Himalayas and doon valley, Mussoorie, also known as Queen of The Hills, stands at an altitude of
                    7000 feet above sea level. With a cool and pleasant climate throughout the year, Mussoorie was once
                    the British summer capital.

                    The British remnants can be seen in the city in the archaic architecture of the hotels and churches.
                    One of the most popular tourist attractions in Mussoorie is The Mall (also known as the Mall Road),
                    which is a slightly steep boulevard with eateries and other shops lining its entire stretch. From
                    the little houses spread around the area to the architecture of even the lamp posts, The Mall gives
                    off a distinct colonial vibe.
